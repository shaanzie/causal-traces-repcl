# Causal Traces with Replay Clocks

This project works in tandem with <href>https://github.com/shaanzie/hybrid-vector-clocks</href>. It uses the Python version of RepCl to design a web interface to show the visualization of a user-provided log. 

To build the visualization, run `python3 ./webpacks/app.py` for the visualization of the sample log provided. For any other log, just replace the file path for the sample log with your own log, and visualization will start with a Flask server on your machine. This is just a testing webserver to show the application of RepCL, but other visualization software can build parsers and visualize the clocks in different ways.

For any issues with running, contact the owner of this repository.
